Notes: This table (above) contains all input parameters for your choose to run ILAMB diagnostic package. 
       The numbers shown above are default to run the package. Based on your purpose, please change
       the numbere as you want. There are 3 parts that you need to note.

       Part 1: List Model names and # of ensembles
       You may choose any model or add new model here. There are 2 items that you can change.
          cmipID: which model you want to include in your diagnostics, 1: include this model, 0: exclude; 
           runID: how many of ensembles you want to use, if you want to include all enembles, please enter 0 
                  or a number larger its availibity. 

       Part 2: List Variables and Diagnostic packages (KeyWords)
       You may choose any variable or diagnostics (Keywords) or add new variables here. 1: include, 0: not include.

       Part 3: List pair of Variables for their relationship
       You may choose any two variables for their relations. The meanings of numbers are explained below:
       0: not include; 1-3: correlation; 4: linear function of one variable (x: column) to another (y: row);
       5: linear prediction of one variable (y: row) with another (x: column); and more .......
